# Predcition_House_Price

In this project, we will address a problem related to the analysis and prediction of housing prices. The original dataset has been obtained from Kaggle and serves as the basis for an ongoing competition. As mentioned in the challenge description, this problem is suitable for feature engineering and ensemble methods. In this project, we  tackled these tasks, among others.

Lastly, even though there are training and test datasets available for download on the web, the test dataset is not labeled. Therefore, we only used the training dataset and cross-validation. However, an interesting exercise would be to expand the project to include prediction on the test dataset for comparison with other results.
